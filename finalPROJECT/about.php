            Children have always looked to adults and envied them for the freedom they have. Grown-ups have jobs and can afford their own cars. But how can children legally get their own set of wheels? Power Wheel cars! Parents can purchase these miniature vehicles for their children, which they can then use to drive throughout the neighborhood and show off how much like an adult they are..

              Remote Control Power Wheels: What to Look For

            Power Wheel cars may all offer the same driving experience, but there are several things you should know about them when you plan to buy one. As you research vehicles for your child, you should pay special attention to the following criteria:
            <br />

            <h2>Design</h2> <br />
Most Power Wheel vehicles are designed to be miniature replicas of "grown up" vehicles such as a Ford Mustang, Jeep or Hummer. A Power Wheels vehicle's ability to imitate an adult driving experience for your child will make all the difference. How the vehicle looks, all the way down to the decals you can use, is indicative of its quality.
<br />

<h2>Battery</h2><br />
Power Wheel cars are powered by electric batteries, which means the strength and size of the battery will influence the vehicle's speed and power. The size of a Power Wheels vehicle's battery is largely indicative of its battery life and the speeds it can reach. 6-volt batteries typically allow a vehicle to travel at around 2.5-MPH for just over an hour. A 12-volt battery will allow your child to drive for upwards of three hours at speeds of 5-MPH.
<br />

<h2>Warranty</h2> <br />
Not all Power Wheel cars come with a warranty, but you'll want to consider this because it will help counterbalance additional future expenses. It isn't uncommon for parts within the motor or battery to fail. In these cases, the cost of replacing those parts can be quite expensive, especially if you have to pay to replace them yourself.

              Reliability

        <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree">
          <div class="panel-body">
            You want a vehicle that will last longer than a single summer. Some Power Wheel vehicles suffer from the design flaw of a short life span, so you'll want to do your homework to make sure the vehicle you get your child won't die soon after the warranty expires.

Give your child the best experience possible when you purchase a Power Wheels car. You should choose one that will not only be enjoyable, but will also keep your child safe if you live in a high-traffic area.
